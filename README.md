# REJOUICE

"Rejouice" is an animated website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It likely features interactive elements and animations that enhance the user experience. The use of CSS for styling and animations, along with JavaScript for dynamic behavior, suggests that the website might include smooth transitions, hover effects, and possibly animated components like banners or sliders. This type of project showcases a good understanding of front-end development skills.

# Usage

## Locomotive Scroll
Locomotive Scroll is used to create smooth scrolling and scroll-based animations on websites. It enhances user experience with fluid scrolling, parallax effects, and animations triggered by scroll position, making the website feel more dynamic and interactive.

## Swiper
Swiper CSS is used for creating responsive, touch-friendly sliders and carousels with smooth transitions and customizable navigation controls.

## GSAP
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is used for creating high-performance, complex animations on websites. It enables smooth transitions, dynamic animations, and precise control over elements with minimal code. GSAP is ideal for creating interactive animations like morphing, scrolling effects, and timeline-based sequences.

## Scroll trigger
ScrollTrigger is used to animate elements based on the user's scroll position. It triggers animations or changes in elements' properties (like opacity, position, or size) as they come into view or reach a specified scroll point, making web pages more interactive and visually engaging.

# Thought

Tried to recreate https://rejouice.com/ by making the use of some frontend knowledge & advance JS Libraries. <br>
Helped me in learing how to destructure websites and build them systematically.
